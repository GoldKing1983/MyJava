https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/discuss/197668/Count-the-Number-of-Islands-O(N)

Requirement:
1) On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
2) Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with another stone on the grid.
3) What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?

input: [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]] Output: 5

       0 . 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6

There are multiple path available to come up with 5. Below is 1 sequence.
       (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1)


Either x or y co-ordinates should be same. So (0,0) -> (1,2) cannot be connected
Another point : we cannot move from last(2,1) to first(0,1). Because whenever move happens, that stone is removed.

This belongs to "InterviewDeduceRequirement". Problem converted to "NumberOfIslands".

1) Think of the problem as "number of island" problem.
2) Here the island is connected, if the "x" or "y" co-ordinate is same.
3) Ans = # of stones â€“ # of islands
4) Note: We are not forming, adjMatrix to do DFS neighbor visits, everyTime input stones are traversed, against
"not visited" stones.
