1) A singly-linked list with both a head and a tail. Remove from the front, append to the tail. 
There you have the theoretical O(1) constant-time complexity (even for worst-case) with less storage.

2) If we know the size of queue at beginning, then we can use circular-array and when array is full we can go circle back to index0.
