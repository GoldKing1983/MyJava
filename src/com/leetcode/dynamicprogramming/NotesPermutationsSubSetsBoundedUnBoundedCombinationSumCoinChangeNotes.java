/*

1) Bounded means, when the same input cannot be used more than 1 time
2) UnBounded means, when the same input can be used more than 1 time
3) Bottom/Up DP is good, when counting is asked.
Ex: Coin Change 2 -->
4) For Permutation/Combination queue/recursionWithForLoop is good when sending combos.
5) For Loop with recursion Ex:GroupSum and For Loop without recursion Ex:SubSetSum.

When comes to permutation in for loop. Don't explain by recursion tree... It is difficult. Explain by list
Ex: IntegerBreak.java, FactorCombinations.java

1) Combination Sum in 2 Flavors

Flavour1
a) output can contain duplicates.
b) output cannot contain duplicates.

Flavour2
a) input can contain duplicates.
b) input cannot contain duplicates
