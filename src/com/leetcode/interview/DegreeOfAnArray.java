Find smallest possible length of a duplicate sub-array

====================================================================================
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2

2 has 2 count, 1 has 2 count. Either 1 length can be answer.

length of 1 is 4thindex-0thindex +1 = 4.
length of 2 is less.
2ndIndex-1stIndex +1 = 2.

====================================================================================
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6

2 has highest count. So get its length. 6thIndex-1stIndex +1 = 6
