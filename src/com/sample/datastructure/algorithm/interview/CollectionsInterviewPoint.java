/*

ArrayList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for the operation at the end of the list.

LinkedList is implemented as a double linked list. Its performance on add and remove is better than Arraylist, 
but worse on get and set methods. TimeComplexity of get is O(n)
LinkedList has O(n) time complexity for arbitrary indices of add/remove, but O(1) for operations at end/beginning of the List.


1) Where dummyNode or sentinel node is needed Ex: AddTwoNumbers
2) ReverseLinkedListRecursion
3) MergeTwoSortedLists
4) RotateList vs RotateArray
5) LinkedListCycleii - FindTheDuplicateNumber
6) LinkedListCycle
7) RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedList
