/*

You see 2 intervals... Sort intervals so that you don't need to worry about reversal case inputs. 
ex: 
interval1=[1,3] interval2=[4,6] -> no merge
interval1=[1,5] interval2=[2,4] -> completely merged
interval1=[1,3] interval2=[2,4] -> partially merged

What possibly you can do
1) merge overlapping intervals (MergeIntervals). 
2) is there an overlap (MeetingRooms)
3) group non-overlapping intervals...return groupCount...Meeting Rooms II
4) keep only one group(merging) optimally by ignoring some intervals...NonOverlappingIntervals
5) Group intervals optimally such that you will form minimum group...MinimumNumberOfArrowsToBurstBalloons
