=====================time-complexity=====================
When it comes to time-complexity, answer carefully based on the solution implementation.

1) search a key in binarySearchTree - O(h)..we tempted to say O(log(n)) based on binarySearch of array, which is wrong. 
2) Matrix Traversal problem mostly - O(m+n)..
 

=====================space-complexity=====================
2) Do BFS of Tree... We tempted to say O(n). But answer is O(W) (i.e) maximum number of element at any level.
