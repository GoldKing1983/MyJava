====================================================Data Analysis Problems====================================================
Some problems may seems complex, but you need to analyze different cases of input.
Once all the cases are covered. Coding is pretty simple.
Ex: RomanToInteger
====================================================Straight Forward Problems=================================================
Some questions are simple and pretty straight-forward.
But don't fall into trap.
Analyze the input clearly.
Cover all the corner cases.
If possible try best code... Ex: TopKFrequentWords. TopKFrequentWordsWorstApproach gets output, but it is not nice approach
Look for Time/Space Complexity

Ex: CountAndSay
====================================================Straight Forward Problems=================================================
1) Some questions are simple and coding is pretty straight-forward.
2) Any fresher can write or any new coder who can understand requirement(knows API) can write.
3) Think for some-time and write optimized code

Ex: TopKFrequentWords
====================================================Tactical Problems=========================================================
For some problems, requirement is easy. If you code straight for the requirement, you can make it, but with "lots of code" and "lots of if conditions".
There will be trick, if  you apply it, coding would be so easy.
1) ToeplitzMatrix
2) RotateArray
3) SquaresOfASortedArray
====================================================Deduce Requirement========================================================
deduce : arrive at (a fact or a conclusion) by reasoning.

Some problem will have a requirement, If we code for the requirement,
		1) we will never end-up output.
		2) we might need to code more.
		3) There will be another simple way of solving the problem with conditions.

1) StringTransformsIntoAnotherString...
2) SuperEggDrop
3) MostStonesRemovedWithSameRowOrColumn
=================================================Cannot solve, if you don't know the trick=======================================
