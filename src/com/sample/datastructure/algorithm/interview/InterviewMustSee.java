RAEAPCT
R - Repeat the Requirement. Make yourself understand clearly.
A - Assumptions - Constraints - 0-N/-NtoN/null/empty/sorted/un-sorted/streamData/duplicateInInput/duplicateInOutput 
E - Examples
A - Approaches - BruteForce(n^2)/ Better n(log(n)) / n / log(n)
P - PseudoCode - micro-module the logic as code before full approach
C - Code - Keep TimeComplexity/SpaceComplexity in mind when choosing dataStructure
T - Test - Positive-StraightForwardCase/CornerCase/Null/Empty
